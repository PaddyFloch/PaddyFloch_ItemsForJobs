#Q & A

How do I configure the script so it can fit my DarkRP server ?                                                                        
The configuration of the script is inside of the `shared.lua` and `init.lua` located here `lua\entities\entity_item4jobs-JobName`

How do I create multiple items for different jobs ?                                                                                   
Duplicate the `entity_item4jobs-example` folder, replace "example" by the name of the job
(`entity_item4jobs-example` --> `entity_item4jobs-police`) and then, edit the `shared.lua` and `init.lua` so it perfectly fits your 
server's needs.

How can I contact you, if I have a problem with the script ?
